We also want to be sure Bradley\u2019s college is covered and that Max will be provided for in the long run, given his special needs [1].

We\u2019re pretty risk-tolerant, so I\u2019d likely hold steady and not make any sudden moves unless it really impacted our retirement plans. I\u2019d probably check in with my wife and maybe talk to someone knowledgeable before doing anything drastic."
